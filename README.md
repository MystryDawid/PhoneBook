# PhoneBook
It was my first project that I made in school.<br>
In this project i learned how to read and write to files in c++ and how to modify cmd looks.


<h3>In this phone book you can :</h3>
<ul>
  <li>choose how many contacts are showing</li>
  <li>change colors of texts and backgrounds</li>
  <li>show contacts</li>
  <li>add a contact</li>
  <li>search for a contact</li>
  <li>save contacts to a binary and text format</li>
  <li>load a book from a text and binary file</li>
</ul>
